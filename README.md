## Introduction

In order to predict house prices for Kings County, Seattle, the Kaggle  data set is chosen 

This data set includes houses sold between May 2014 to May 2015

## Objectives of this project are :
Does a set of independent variables do a good job of predicting the dependent variable?

Which independent variables are significant predictors of the dependent variable?

The multiple R is 0.727881, which indicates a strong linear relationship between the predictors and price.

The R-squared is 0.5298, which indicates that 52.98% of the variance in the price can be explained by the predictors such as bedrooms, bathrooms, square feet of living, square feet of lot, floors, condition, grade year built, square feet living of the neighbors and square feet lot of neighbors.

There is a strong positive relation between actual price and predicted price.

The actual price of a house is $538,000 and Its predicted price is $500,860.71.

That means the variables, used to predict the house price, are having a strong relation to determining the house price.

## Conclusion :
The dependent variables such as bedroom, bathroom, square feet of living, square feet of lot, number of floors, condition, grade, year of built, square feet of neighboring houses, and the square feet lot of neighboring houses, worked very well in predicting house price using linear regression.

The grade of the house, square feet of living, latitude, square feet above, square feet of the neighboring house, and bathroom are good predictors of the house.

The house price of 2 bedroom house built in 1942 may cost $418,957

The house price of 3 bedroom house built in 1955 may cost $530,615
